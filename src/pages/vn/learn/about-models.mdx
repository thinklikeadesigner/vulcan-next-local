# Step 3: Discover models

## Thinking in models

You application will certainly manipulate concepts that exist in real life.
A blog is about managing Authors, Posts, Comments.
A restaurant website is about managing Menus, Reservations, Payments.

In Vulcan, we call those concepts "models": they are modelling the real world, using JavaScript.

In real-life, an Author is a human-being, with an education level, professionnal experiences, personnal tastes...
A very complicated object!
In Vulcan, an Author will be a JSON file, that describes the author `firstName`, `lastName`, and list of `publications`,
and also a few other information like who can create/update author's data.

We only keep the "fields" that matters for our web application.

## Describing a model using a schema

Vulcan provides a Sample model in `src/vulcan-demo/models/sampleModel.ts`. Open this file and take a look at it.

### The base fields

All models will have:

- an `_id`: this is the document unique identifier in the Mongo database
- an `userId`: this is the id of the user that created the document. This special field will be used to tell who "`owns`" this document
- timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`): those information are added by Mongo when creating the document. `createdAt` is the most useful,
  because it lets us sort documents by creation date.

### Your custom fields

Of course, you can also add your custom fields to the model.
A great way to discover Vulcan possibilities is to press ctrl+space, within a field: it will show you all possible fields, thanks
to TypeScript typings.

```ts
// Example of a custom field in a model
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    optional: true,
    canRead: ["guests"],
    canUpdate: ["admins", "owners"],
    canCreate: ["admins", "owners"],
  },
```

The model provides a lot of information. In this example, the `firstName` is an optional, string value.
We also see that everybody can see the firstName, but only the Author himself or an admin can modifiy it ("owners" permission).

## Export your model

The schema describe all the fields of a model. But a model is more than just its field,
the same way an Author is not just a name and a list of publication.

After you have defined your schema, you can use the `createGraphqlModel` to give it life.
You can configure model-level permissions, like who can see or update documents of this model.

```tsx
export const modelDef: CreateGraphqlModelOptionsShared = {
  name: "sample",
  schema,
  graphql: {
    typeName,
    multiTypeName,
  },
  permissions: {
    canCreate: ["members"],
    canUpdate: ["owners", "admins"],
    canDelete: ["owners", "admins"],
    canRead: ["members", "admins"],
  },
};
export const SampleModel = createGraphqlModel(modelDef);
```

Vulcan automates a lot of things based on your model:

- generating the corresponding GraphQL server (to provide data to any app)
- generating the corresponding GraphQL client (to get data in your app)
- generating an admin area, etc.

[Read ðŸ”¥Vulcan Fire documentation for more info.](https://vulcan-docs.vercel.app/docs/vulcan-fire/)

**Always remember to export your model in `src/models/index` to activate this automated generation.**

## Go to step 4

First, please answer this question:

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="How many models are exported in src/models/index.tsx?"
  answers={[models.length.toString(), (models.length + 1).toString()]}
  validAnswerIdx={0}
  ifOk={
    <NextMuiButton variant="contained" href="/learn/server-only-models">
      Click to go to next step
    </NextMuiButton>
  }
/>

export default function AboutModelsPage(props) {
  return <LearnLayout {...props} />;
}
