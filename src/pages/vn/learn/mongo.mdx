# Step 2: Plug the database

Vulcan is a **full-stack** framework. It means that it provides a way to create user interfaces (front-end) and to manage a web server (back-end).
Most back-end need to manipulate data, using a database, like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
This is what we sometimes call the ["3-tier architecture"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture).

Therefore, for Vulcan to work, you need to setup a Mongo database on your computer.

**If you are installing Vulcan Next from [CodeSandbox Projects](https://projects.codesandbox.io/)**: the database is already setup for you.
You don't need to do anything and you can skip to next step already. You can still read this page just to understand how Vulcan Next works.

## Prerequesites

- Install Docker ([link for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [link for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)).
- (Optional) Install [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/fr-fr/download-center/compass), the official tool to visualize your data

## Run Mongo

If Docker is installed, this magic command will either install and run, or just run Mongo on your computer.

```sh
yarn run mongo
```

You should already be able to access the database in Compass, using the following URI:

```
mongodb://localhost:27017/vulcan-next-app
```

## Link Mongo to your Vulcan application

Now, you'll want your Vulcan Next app to connect to this database.

To do so, you need to configure a global environment variable, `MONGO_URI`.
We are going to use [Next.js configuration features](https://blog.vulcanjs.org/how-to-set-configuration-variables-in-next-js-a81505e43dad).

```sh
# Duplicate ".env.development" to create a ".env.development.local"
cp .env.development .env.development.local
```

You can change the values of this `.env.development.local`: it
will only exist on your own computer, so you can even put password
and secret values here.

You'll find a line like this:

```
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://johnDoe:T74OcxqL15TRt7Zn@lbke-demo-ara2d.mongodb.net/sample_restaurants?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
# MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/vulcan-next-app"
```

You can comment the first value, and remove the second one:

```
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/vulcan-next-app"
```

Now, Vulcan Next will use your local database.

**Restart your server for this change to apply (ctrl+C in your terminal and then `yarn run dev`).**

## Go to step 3

If this button is still disabled:

- check if you Mongo server is running correctly
- check that your app runs on port 3000 (and not 3001!), otherwise we cannot send request to the graphql backend to verify if you run Mongo
- restart Vulcan Next (ctrl+C in your terminal, and `yarn run dev` again)
